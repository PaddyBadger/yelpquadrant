yelpquadrant
============
This is an Express.js app, using D3 that takes a search query from the user, passes it to the Yelp API and scrapes information from the Yelp reviews to find keywords that place the resulting Javascript objects into the Quadrant, with links to the Yelp pages if users want more information.

Any query that you can make on Yelp would work with this app.
